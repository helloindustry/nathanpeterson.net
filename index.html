            I write regularly on 
            <a href="https://nathanpeterson.substack.com" target="_blank">my newsletter</a>
             and welcome emails to

        <h2 id="speaking">Speaker for Conferences and Events</h2>
        <p>
            I speak at conferences and events to help us slow down, feel more present, and find a deeper sense of togetherness and whole-hearted hopefulness.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have spoken on a national level for large conferences, staff retreats, and student events.
		</p>
		<p>
			My presentations are from 20-90 minutes and include speaking, workshop-style exploration, and music.
		</p>
		<p>
			I speak to the unique season we find ourselves in today, with so many people struggling to make sense of the profound isolation and upheaval in our world. Taking a moment to bring our awareness to where we are — to be fully here and together — is a powerful way to deepen our sense of well-being, and to renew our ability to engage fully with the things right in front of us… the things which matter most.
		</p>
		<p>
			By including a moment like this as part of your event, you are supporting your attendees on a foundational human level, unifying them despite personal and cultural variables, and increasing their capacity to more fully receive and benefit from all your event has to offer. I look forward to partnering with you in this!
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently accepting a limited number of engagements for speaking in 2022/23.

        <h2 id="concerts">Concerts</h2>
        <p>
            My concerts are a space to experience togetherness and healing.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="">Togetherness Tour</a>
			 is a series of concerts for breathing and being together again. If you would like to host a concert for your community, city or organization, <a href="mailto:booking@nathanpeterson.net">let me know</a>!
        </p>
		
		<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
		<p>
			I write songs about life, loss, grief, healing, faith, and hope.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a href="https://ffm.to/npmasks" target="_blank">Masks</a> 
			is my newest single release. I wrote this in the thick of Covid. It’s not a pro or anti statement; it’s a song about being here for each other.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			My latest two solo albums — a collection of songs about grief and loss, beauty and rest — were recorded during and after the life of our beautiful 4th child, Olivia.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a href="https://ffm.to/npda" target="_blank">Dance Again</a> 
			is my latest solo album. It contains songs of grief — darkness, anger, healing, and hope... my most intimate writing to date.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a href="https://ffm.to/soami" target="_blank">So Am I</a> 
			is my debut solo album — 4 songs about living with uncertainty, fear, and miracles. I wrote this album during my daughter Olivia’s life — she was not supposed to survive birth, but lived 14 months. She changed our view of life forever.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			My albums Matter and MaryAnn were recorded with my band, <a href="https://helloindustry.com" target="_blank">Hello Industry</a>. They are collections of songs about identity and finding your Voice.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a href="https://hypeddit.com/helloindustry/matter" target="_blank">Matter</a> 
			is my latest rock album. It's is about wrestling through fear and insecurity to discover our intrinsic value as human beings.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a href="https://hypeddit.com/nathanpetersonandhelloindustry/maryann" target="_blank">MaryAnn</a> 
			is my sophomore rock album — songs about finding our identity.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a href="https://hypeddit.com/nathanpetersonandhelloindustry/fooled" target="_blank">Fooled</a> 
			is my very first album, recorded with my band <a href="https://helloindustry.com" target="_blank">Hello Industry</a> in 2006.
		</p>

        <h2 id="books">Author</h2>
        <p>
			Over the course of our daughter Olivia's life, I wrote two books about grief,  healing and rest.
		</p>

        <p>
            <a href="books/dance-again/index.html">Dance Again: Grief is Healing</a>
			 is a book I wrote at a time in my life when I was experiencing what many of us are experiencing today: uncertainty, fear, and grief.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="books/so-am-i/">So Am I: Life, Living, and Letting Go</a>
             is a collection of my writings during the 14-month life of our beautiful, terminal daughter, Olivia.
        </p>

        <h2 id="helloindustry">Founding member of band Hello Industry</h2>

        <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
        <p>
			I live in Chicago Illinois with my beautiful wife, Heather, who is a wonderful musician and has played with me for over 20 years. We have 5 children — three boys and two girls — one of whom was born with Trisomy 18 and now has gone ahead of us.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was born in Chicago, lived in Colorado and Germany as a small child, and grew up in the cornfields of Sycamore Illinois.
		</p>
		<p>
			I write songs and books, play concerts, and lead workshops about  rest, healing, hope, faith, breath, and voice.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="bio">Official bio</h2>
		<p>
			Chicago-based singer-songwriter Nathan Peterson has been creating music as Hello Industry for two decades.
		</p>
		<p>
			After four album releases and numerous iterations of Hello Industry’s live show, including their fully classical Black and White concert, Nathan has stripped everything down to only a guitar, his voice, and a song. Nathan is currently celebrating the release of two solo albums and two books — So Am I: Life, Living, and Letting Go and Dance Again: Grief is Healing — about the life and passing of his daughter, Olivia, as well as his latest Single Release, Masks: a song about finding togetherness in the midst of covid.
		</p>
		<p>
			During Nathan’s 20 years of writing, recording, and performing, he has created a body of work which invites our culture to rest, here and now, in the midst of the storms of life. Nathan’s words and voice invite us inward, toward our own Center, where our fear is the loudest; where our strength and hope are their brightest.
		</p>
		<p>
			Born in Chicago and raised in Germany, Colorado, and the cornfields of Sycamore Illinois, Nathan now lives with his wife and 5 children in Chicago.
